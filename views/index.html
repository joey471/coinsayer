    <h2>What is coin selection?</h2>
    <p>
      When you send bitcoin, you must chose exactly which "inputs" to use. This has a profound effect on privacy and overall costs.
      And the amount of possible choices grows exponential with the amount of "coins" you have!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this problem is so hard that it is categorized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness" target="_blank">NP-hard</a>,
      and in the general-case not really solvable.
      However, at coinsayer we have developed state of the art algorithms,
      using state of the art solvers on our server farm to solve this problem as efficiently as possible â€”
      resulting in huge amounts of cost and privacy savings over previous coin selection algorithms.
